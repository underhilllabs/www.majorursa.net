Provide an input filter which highlights inline codes by using <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>.


Prerequisite
============
You need a working Pygments on your host.
See <a href="http://pygments.org/download/">how to install Pygments</a>.


Installation
============
* Enable this module.
* Go to admin/config/content/formats page, configure the text format in which you want to enable Pygmentizer.
* In the configuration page check <strong>Highlight inline codes with Pygments</strong>. It'd be better to give Pygmentizer a lower weight or say a higher priority.
* At bottom of configuration page switch to settings tab of Pygmentizer.
* Set your Pygments' binary path, choose the way you want to wrap your inline codes and pick a highlighting style for you web site.
* As mentioned at first in settings tab, don't forget to allow HTML tags required by Pygmentizer if you have <strong>HTML Filter</strong> enabled.


Usage
=====
Depends on the codes wrapper you choose, you can put inline codes in either <pygmentize[ lang=php|html|...]></pygmentize> or <code></code>. The former way makes it possible to specify language. However Pygments will try to guess it if not explicitly specified. The latter way works with HTML <code> tag.


Todo
====
* Need to test under Windows environment.
